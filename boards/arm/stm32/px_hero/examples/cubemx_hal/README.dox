The 32.768 kHz crystal (&plusmn;20 ppm accuracy) is the clock source for the LSE 
(Low Speed External) oscillator. The LSE is selected as the clock source for the 
RTC (Real Time Clock) in the RTC Source Mux symbol.

The 16 MHz HSI RC (High Speed Internal RC Oscillator; &plusmn;2% accuracy) is 
enabled and selected as the clock source for the PLL (Phase Locked Loop) in the 
PLL Source Mux symbol. The PLL is configured to multiply the input clock 
frequency by 4 and divide it by 2.

The 32 MHz PLLCLK is selected as the clock source for SYSCLK (System Clock) in 
the System Clock Mux symbol. The SYSCLK is then distributed to all of the 
different peripherals.

The 48 MHz RC Oscillator (&plusmn;4% accuracy) is enabled and selected as the 
clock source for USBCLK in the 48M Source Mux symbol. The CRS (Clock Recovery 
System) is configured to use the USB SOF ([Start Of Frame](https://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb3.shtml)) 
packet that is received every 1 ms to improve the accuracy of the clock.
